For our final project in "Applied Statistics and Visualization for Analytics," we conducted a "**Credit Card Default Analysis.**" Our team, consisting of three members—Pravalika, Sowdhamini, and myself—aimed to analyze a dataset titled "Default of Credit Card Clients" which will provide insights into the patterns and factors influencing credit card default occurrences, aiding in risk assessment and decision-making in the financial domain.

The primary objectives of the analysis are:

-   Certain demographic groups exhibit a higher or lower likelihood of defaulting on credit card payments

-   The most important features for predicting credit default risk

-   Distinct patterns of credit limit utilization among users.
